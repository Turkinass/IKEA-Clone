# IKEA Shop Clone
A shop clone for IKEA Saudi Arabia Shop

The project is hosted statically at Github Pages [View demo](https://turkinass.github.io/IKEA-Clone/public/index.html)

You may compare it to the original website that we based it on www.ikea.com/sa/en/, yet take into account that the website may change since we worked on it.
